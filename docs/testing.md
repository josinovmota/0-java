# How to test the project

First of all be sure that you already downloaded the project (you can use the first part of the [building guide](building.md) in order to do that) so we can start doing the **unit tests**

Now, with everything settled we can properly do the unit tests with its command:

```
mvn test
```

If there's any doubt about Apache Maven lifecycle, you can use the [explanation](../exercises/maven-lifecycle.md) about its phases.
