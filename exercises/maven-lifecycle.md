# Maven commands lifecycle

Whenever we use `Maven` as our **project manager** we need to use commands like `mvn install`, `mvn compile` and so on

As we learn, Maven commands have some sort of hierarchy. To be more specific, whenever we type a command like `mvn compile`
other commands that are lower in the hierarchy will be executed too. Let me explain a little better

| Ordem | Comando  | O que faz |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1     | validate |        |
